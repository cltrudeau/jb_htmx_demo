# JetBrains HTMX Demo

This is sample code to go along with a talk on JetBrain's YouTube channel,
covering how to use HTMX with Django.

The full project is in the BookThing/ directory, while the steps/ directory
contains the state of code as features are added. The features are as follows:

* steps/step1: base Django project that displays the title and author
  information for some books
* steps/step2: lazy loading feature
* steps/step3: adding basic search
* steps/step4: search-as-you-type
